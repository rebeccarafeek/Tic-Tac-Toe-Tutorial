Tic Tac Toe Tutorial Project
This project is a result of following the React documentation (https://react.dev/learn) and completing the Tic Tac Toe tutorial to strengthen my understanding of React concepts and best practices.

This tutorial provided a solid foundation for understanding React's core concepts and how they come together to build interactive web applications.
